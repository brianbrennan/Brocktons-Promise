			<h3>About Us</h3>


			<h5>What is Brocton's Promise?</h5>

			<p>
				In 2005, Brockton leaders and community members formed a coalition to provide five promises to the young people of Brockton. When fulfilled, these promises serve as protective factors and help support the healthy development of youth. Brockton’s Promise is: Caring Adults, Safe Places, Effective Education, a Healthy Start, and Opportunities to Serve.
			</p>

			<p>
				Brockton’s Promise is dedicated to improving the lives of Brockton youth through the <a href="promises.html">Five Promises</a>. Giving leadership opportunities to youth empowers them and fosters the development of a passion for service at a young age. Far too often, youth are marginalized in their communities.  Brockton’s Promise recognizes the important contributions that youth make when given the opportunity. Through involvement in their community, youth gain the knowledge and experience to mature into civically engaged adults. Furthermore, studies show that youth who are engaged with their community are less likely to commit crimes or acts of vandalism as they gain a heightened sense of pride in where they live.
			</p>

			<p>
				Not only do we want youth to be involved, but we want to provide them with the vehicles through which their voice can be heard. Through participation in activities such as the Brockton Mayor’s Youth Summit, Brockton After Dark, and the Mayor’s Youth Council, youth engage in meaningful learning activities and have opportunities to discuss issues that affect them.
